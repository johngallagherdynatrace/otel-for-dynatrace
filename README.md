# OpenTelemetry Skills for AI Coding Agents

Vendor-neutral skills that teach AI coding agents how to instrument applications with OpenTelemetry.
Covers SDK setup across languages, semantic conventions, Collector pipelines, and OTTL transformations.
Works with any OTLP-compatible backend.

Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend agent capabilities, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format.
Maintained by [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com).

> [!TIP]
> These skills have been improved using [Tessl](https://tessl.io).
> Try it out for your own agent skills, it's worth it.

## Installation

**Install with [skills](https://skills.sh/) CLI** (universal, works with any [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible tool):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/dash0hq/agent-skills --all
# or a single skill:
npx skills add https://github.com/dash0hq/agent-skills --skill otel-semantic-conventions
```

For tool-specific installation instructions (Claude Code, Cursor, Tessl, and others), see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## How to use

Once installed, skills load automatically and the agent picks them up when a task matches.

**Examples:**
```
Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation to my app
```
```
My traces are broken — spans show up as separate roots instead of a connected trace
```
```
Set up an OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline that forwards to Dash0
```
```
Write an OTTL expression to redact credit card numbers from log bodies
```
```
Ensure that my HTTP server spans have the correct attributes
```
```
Help me fix high-cardinality metrics that are blowing up my costs
```

## Why vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry

These skills are built around the OpenTelemetry specification, not any single backend.
The output is standard OTLP telemetry that any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend can ingest.

Vendor lock-in in observability comes from proprietary agents and attribute schemas.
Skills in this repository avoid both: they guide agents to use OpenTelemetry SDKs and the OpenTelemetry Collector, and to follow the upstream [Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) for attribute, span, and metric naming.

## Why semantic conventions matter

[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) define standardized names, types, and semantics for telemetry attributes, metric names, span names, and status codes.
Following them is the single highest-leverage thing you can do for observability quality.

When instrumentation follows semantic conventions:
- Auto-instrumentation libraries, dashboards, and alerting rules work out of the box.
- Service maps, operation grouping, and error tracking derive correct results without manual configuration.
- Cross-service queries return consistent results because every service speaks the same attribute language.

When conventions are missing or inconsistent, these capabilities degrade silently: no errors, just incomplete data, broken topology views, and fragmented queries.

## Instrumentation score

Guidance in these skills aligns with the [Instrumentation Score](https://github.com/instrumentation-score/spec) specification, a vendor-neutral corpus of guidance that quantifies how well a service follows OpenTelemetry best practices.
The spec defines impact-weighted rules across resources, spans, metrics, and logs.
Following this guidance helps your services score higher, which means better observability outcomes downstream.

## Automation with Claude Code

You can configure [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to apply these skills automatically, both in interactive sessions and in headless CI/CD pipelines.

### Project instructions via CLAUDE.md

Add a `CLAUDE.md` file to your repository root with instructions that tell Claude Code when to use the skills.
Claude Code loads this file at the start of every session.

```markdown
# Observability

This project uses OpenTelemetry for observability.
When adding or modifying instrumentation, follow the guidance from the installed `dash0hq/agent-skills` skills.

When working on application code or deployment specs, use the `otel-instrumentation` skill.
When working on Collector configuration, use the `otel-collector` skill.
When choosing or reviewing telemetry attributes, use the `otel-semantic-conventions` skill.
When writing or debugging OTTL expressions, use the `otel-ottl` skill.
```

### Headless mode in CI/CD

Use `claude -p` to run Claude Code non-interactively in a pipeline.
This enables automated instrumentation reviews, skill-guided code generation, and PR checks.

```bash
# Review instrumentation quality on a pull request
claude -p "Review the OpenTelemetry instrumentation changes in this PR. \
  Check for missing context propagation, incorrect span status handling, \
  and semantic convention violations." \
  --allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob"
```

#### GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Instrumentation review

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install skills
        run: npx skills add dash0hq/agent-skills

      - name: Review instrumentation

            Post your findings as a summary." \
            --allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob" \
            --output-format json > review.json
